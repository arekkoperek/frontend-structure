Frontend test

Info
========
1. This is a sample frontend structure I use to set up a project. There are sample fonts and pictures.All trademarks mentioned herein belong to their respective owners. Please do not redistribute this code.
2. Basic RWD - project got only basic RWD to show collapsing elements - no navigation styles and responsive images.


Description
========
This is not a complete project. This should give a general view of how I'm structuring the html/css/javascript. 

## CSS
For generating CSS I'm using Sass as a preprocessor. Output file is not minimized to give a general look of what's happening inside css. 

## JS
For modularizing and asynchrous loading of javascript parts (AMD) I use require.js
